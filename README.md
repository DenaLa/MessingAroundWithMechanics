# MessingAroundWithMechanics
I wanted to see how far I could go planning out mechanics for a jrpg in java.

For now it doesn't seem to be very far, so it only has some basic classes and some half implemented battle mechanics. 
I'll have to figure out how to properly iron it out in the near future.

## I am not ironing it out
There's a lot of systems that I don't know how to replicate within java... I want to move onto Unity if I'm going to attempt this again... I hope I can make something small there!
